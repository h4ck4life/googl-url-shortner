googl-url-shortner
==================

A small Android Library to create a shortened URL using the goo.gl shortener service from Google.

This uses the API documented at https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/.

This could be used outside of Android, by taking the src dir and supplying the apache http client libraries (the only Android sourced dependancy).
